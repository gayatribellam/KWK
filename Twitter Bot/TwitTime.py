Amb. Yovanovitch is a profile in patriotism and courage. All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to her and the career diplomats and public servants who serve with honor and now find themselves under a spotlight they didn’t seek. For them, the national interest always comes first.

We don’t yet have all the details of the horrifying events in Santa Clarita. But we do know that in America today, children are scared to go to school. Parents and teachers are terrified. And that can’t stand. It is time to hold the NRA and our leaders in Washington accountable.

I strongly condemn the rocket attacks on the citizens of southern and central Israel. Israel has a right to defend itself against acts of terror that set back any progress towards peace and will only serve to inflame the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
